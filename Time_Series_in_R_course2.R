#ggpairs with baseR : pairs(df) -> build charts without cor calculation

##STATIONARITY
#Property we want in a time series for forecasting (although we've seen in course 1 that handy "forecast" package 
#functions will handle NonStationarity for us)
#NO Systematic change in mean. i.e. no trend
#No systematic change in variance
#No periodic variations

#For NonStationary time series we'll do transformarions to make it so

##AUTOCOVARIANCE
#Measures the linear dependence between two variables
#Autocovariance, therefor, measures the dependece between two different observations in  the same variable
#(eg. two different observations separated in time)

#Generate Random time-series data and plot it
purely_random_process <- ts(rnorm(100))
plot(purely_random_process)

#Plot the autocovariance coefficients
acf(purely_random_process, type = "covariance")

#Plot the autocorrelation function (correlogram)
acf(purely_random_process, type = "correlation")
#Notice that lag=0 has always cor=1, beacause it is measuring the correlation of the observations with themselves

##RANDOM WALK MODEL

#Random Walks are NonStationary processes (varying mean, non bounded variance)
#Random Walk is an autoregressive process: each observation is correlated to the one before

#Simulate 1000 data points at random walk
rw <- ts(cumsum(rnorm(1000)))
plot(rw)
acf(rw, lag.max = 100 , type = "correlation")
#putting the command above fully in between "()" will print out all the coefficients

#Another way to simulate 1000 data points at random walk, fixing the starting point at 0
rw <- c()
rw[1] <- 0
for (i in 2:1000) {
        rw[i] <- rw[i-1]+rnorm(1)
}
rw <- ts(rw)
plot(rw)
acf(rw, lag.max = 100 , type = "correlation")

#Removing the trend
#In a random walk, the datapoints are autocorrelated, as seen the ACF above
#However, the differences between them are not (by design, since we generated them with rnorm())
#So, if we take only the differences between points at a given lag (coeff. d), we have now a Stationary time series,
#because the differences are not autocorrelated (as shown by the acf plot below)

rw.diff <- diff(rw) #lag = 1
plot(rw.diff)
acf(rw.diff, type = "correlation")


##MOVING AVERAGE MODEL

#Moving averages are (weakly) Stationary processes (constant mean, limited variance)

#Simulating MA(2) (order q=2)
#noise:
ma.noise <- rnorm(10000)
#variable placeholder
ma.2 <- c()
#fill ma.2 (starts in position 3, since it will a mocing average of 2 previous periods - MA(2))
for (i in 3:10000) {
        ma.2[i] <- ma.noise[i] + 0.8*ma.noise[i-1] + 0.4*ma.noise[i-2]  #the coefficients here are arbitrary
}                                                                       #could be anything (<1)
#shift data to the left by two units and put time-series structure
ma_process <- ts(ma.2[3:1000])

#plot and correlogram-it-out
plot(ma_process)
acf(ma_process, type = "correlation")
#note from the correlogram that the r dies out at the degree of the MA
#for an MA, autocorrelation coefficients will be significant until the point of the MA degree/order; at q=order+1, r=0


#A moving average process of order q, MA(q), has an ACF that cuts off after q lags

#So, if you have an MA() process with enough terms that you believe the ACF is well estimated,
#and the ACF cuts off after 4 lags, you can be reasonably sure you have an MA(4) process.

#An autoregressive process of order p, an AR(p), has a PACF that cuts off after p lags.

#So if we know that we have an autoregressive process and are looking to determine the order of the
#process, we produce a PACF and observe where it â€œcuts off

#In the PACF plot, we remove the linear effects of all the terms between the two random variables (i.e the lags
#between lags).
#The excess correlation at lag=k not accounted for by a (k-1)st order model, is the partial correlation at lag K.

## MODEL SELECTOIN CRITERIAS

#Simulation 1: generate and AR(2) process

#Specifying parameters:
# order = c(2,0,0)
# ar =c( 0.7, -.2)

#the vector "order" is listed as (p,d,q), so we are generating and AR(p=2)
#and its coefficients are listed in the vector "ar"

data = arima.sim(list(order = c(2,0,0), ar =c( 0.7, -.2)), n = 10000)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
acf(data, main="ACF of AR Data of Second Order")
acf(data, type="partial", main="PACF of Time Series")

#Estimate the parameters of the model with the function arima(),
#but we need to tell it the order of the process

arima(data, order=c(2,0,0))
#Observe that the estimated parameter are, indeed, what we set them to be.

#However, we will likely never know the order opf the process beforehand
#So let's try and generate estimates for various values of p:

SSE=NULL
AIC=NULL
for (p in 1:5) {
        m = arima(data, order=c(p,0,0))
        SSE[p] = sum(resid(m)^2)
        AIC[p] = m$aic
        print( m$coef )
        print( paste(m$aic, sum(resid(m)^2)) )
}

#From the output we observe that there's a big drop in both AIC and SSE from
#a first order model (p=1) to a second order model (p=2)
#Then, from p=2 to p=3, AIC and SSE do not change significantly and the
#added coefficient (ar3) is nearly zero
#Finally, from p=3 to p=4, AIC and SSE start both rising again
#We may conclude, therefore, that this model has p=2

#(similarly to the adj-R^2, the AIC sets a penalty to increasing number of variables in the model)
#so the best model is the one with the lowest AIC and/or SSE


## MIXED MODELS : AR(p) + MA(q) : ARMA(p,q)

# For an ARMA(p,q) model, we will have:

                                #xt = noise + AR piece + MA piece

#Real life time-series have many components (trend, seasonality, noise) and are most likely always NonStationary
#More often than not, a mixed model will be more efiicient in provinding us with less coefficients to describe it
#i.e. modeling it via ARMA(p,q), rather than an AR(p) or MA(q)

#From the output, the best fitted model (parsimony + low AIC + low SSE) is:

#We will take a look at the residual analysis
sarima(log(suv), 1,1,0,0,1,1,12 )
#We see no autocorrelation amongst residuals, which are normally distributed around zero, with a few extreme values, though.


#The function sarima.for() produces arima forecasting with arguments:
#sarima.for(data , forecast horizon, p,d,q,P,D,Q , S=Seasonal Period)
#So, let's generate the forecast of our log-transformed data, using the parameters of our chosen model,
#for the next 12 months:
a<-sarima.for(log(suv),12,1,1,0,0,1,1,12)

#The function plot.ts() has built-in specific paramenters for time-series plotting
#We are interested in the final forecasted sales, not the log-transformed version
#So we are plotting the original data "suv" with the predicted sales "exp(a$pred)"

## FORECASTING WITH SIMPLE EXPONENTIAL SMOOTHING (SES)

rain.data <- scan("http://robjhyndman.com/tsdldata/hurst/precip1.dat",skip=1)
rain.ts <- ts(rain.data, start=c(1813))

par( mfrow=c(1,2) )
hist(rain.data, main="Annual London Rainfall 1813-1912",
     xlab="rainfall in inches")
qqnorm(rain.data,main="Normal Plot of London Rainfall")
qqline(rain.data)


plot.ts(rain.ts, main="Annual London Rainfall 1813-1912",
        xlab="year", ylab="rainfall in inches")
acf(rain.ts, type = "correlation", main="ACF: London Rainfall")
acf(rain.ts, type = "partial", main="PACF: London Rainfall")

#Our ACF charts are not very helpful right now: we don't see any significant correlations appear
#Even auto.arima() kind of gives up on us

library(forecast)
auto.arima(rain.ts)

#It gives us the model ARIMA(0,0,0) and says we should move forward with the average alone.

#We can move to the Holt-Winters methos (see pdf "Introduction to Forecast_SSE" in the folder for details)

HoltWinters(rain.ts, beta=FALSE, gamma=FALSE)
#Here, we called a Holt-Winters without trend and without seasonal component
#THe alpha given by this method is the one that minimizes SSE.

#The component alpha will tell us how far away in the past we are looking to consider the forecasts for future values
#The larger the alpha (closer to 1), the heavier the weight for more recent values;
#For alpha =1, X(t+1) = X(t); for alpha=1, we would be predicting that the next value in the time-series will just be
#the same as thje last value.
#The smaller the alpha, the further in the past we are considering to predict future values.

#Conclusion: we can build a forecast by taking a weighted average of past values,
#with weights given corresponding to the geometric series (i.e. exponentially decreasing).
#This gives a forecasting method called Simple Exponential Smoothing or SES.
#This method gives greater weight to those values in the series closer to the forecast, and
#lesser weight to terms further in the past.

#While SES this is not a bad approach, it is certainly limited and doesnâ€™t include some other factors
#which may be driving your system. We would like to build on this approach but also include
#seasonal and trend effects.

#The Holt-Winters method with alpha, beta and gamma, also called triple exponential smoothing, does just that.
#alpha: levels
#beta: trend
#gamma: seasonality

#Pros of this method:
#low data storage requirements
#easily automated
#adapts to changes in trends and seasonal patterns: slow-downs or speed-ups in demand, or changes in consumer beahviour
#may all be accomodated as new data comes in.


## Let us see another example

data <- AirPassengers
plot(data)

#ARIMA Approach

#We observe upwards trend and a seasonality, as well as increasing variance as we move to more recent times

#Remember: log-transforming the data should rid us the increasing variance
data.log <- log(data)
plot(data.log)

#Still not stationary;
#We may differece it to detrend

data.log.diff1 <- diff(log(data))
plot(data.log.diff1)

#Seems stationary now.

#Then we may analyze the autocorrelations:
library(astsa)
acf2(data.log.diff1)
#ACF suggests an MA process with q=1 and Q=1
#PACF suggest an AR process with p=1 and P=1
#And seasonality S=12

#Let us see what the calculation tell us
auto.arima(data.log)

#The suggest model is SARIMA(0,1,1,0,1,1)_12
model<- arima(data.log, order = c(0,1,1), seasonal = list(order=c(0,1,1), period=12))
autoplot(forecast(model))
forecast(model)

#Let us analyze the residuals:
sarima(data, 0,1,1,0,1,1,12)

#We may build the forecast and plot it directly at one go with the function sarima.for() from "astsa" package
fcst <- sarima.for(data.log,24,0,1,1,0,1,1,12)

#We are interested in the forecast in number of passangers, not log:
plot.ts(c(data,exp(fcst$pred)), main='Monthly sales + Forecast', ylab='Passengers', lwd=3)

#THe forecasted number of passengers may retrieved from:
fcst$pred #log
exp(fcst$pred) #Number of passengers


#HOLT-WINTERS APPROACH

library(forecast)
library(astsa)
data <- AirPassengers
data.hw <- HoltWinters(data)
data.hw.fcst <- forecast(data.hw)
#The function forecast() already recognizes that this is a Holt-Winters model, becaude it was built with HoltWinters()
autoplot(data.hw.fcst)

#THe forecasted number of passengers may retrieved from:
data.hw.fcst$mean #Number of passengers

#WE MAY COMPARE THE PREDICTIONS FROM BOTH MODELS
compare <- data.frame("month" = c(1:24) , "with SARIMA" = exp(fcst$pred) , "with HW" = data.hw.fcst$mean)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(compare) +
        geom_line(aes(month, with.SARIMA, colour = "blue")) +
        geom_line(aes(month, with.HW, colour = "red")) +
        labs(x = "Month" , y = "Number of passengers" , colour = "Method: blue = SARIMA | red = HW")
